        <p>This map is a representation of the forest make up of the Southeastern United States. Simply put this map displays softwoods (green), hardwoods (blue), and mixed (brown). The ranges of dark to light colors represent ages of the forest land. The darker the color, the older the forest. The lighter the color the younger the forest. You will note many areas with dark clusters of forests, these are the locations of protected forests. (created 9.24.12)</p>

        <p>This map was successfully used in order to obtain a new project. The map displays current forest supply (i.e. current standing forest) as well as forest extraction points (various sawmills). This will illustrates the potential defecit the client may encounter if an analysis is not run over the woodbasin.</p>
